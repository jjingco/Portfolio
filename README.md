# PORTFOLIO INTRODUCTION
<div>
  <h1>💖 Welcome to my Portfolio 💖 </h1>
  <p> Most of my samples came from in-class projects through the 15 week Web Development program at the South
    Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). However, outside of the program I have also dabbled in Python,
    C++ and C#.</p>
  <p>I love to continuously learn and collaborate with other web devs so any feedback is always welcomed! I hope you enjoy my
  site!</p>

  <h2> Breakdown for Each Sample: </h2>

    <h3>CSS Animation Sample</h3>
    <p> The objective of this in-class assignment was to take a week's worth of teaching in design principles and
    project it through a CSS animation example. The animation can be anything you like as long as it is centered around
    content.</p>
    <p> Though I used HTML to set the base structure for this webpage, I used CSS to animate the floating boxes. 
      By using a Z-index, it made it easier to put a div tag on top of the content and have that div tag slide from 
      one corner to the next </p>

  <div>
    <h3>JavaScript Animation Sample</h3>
    <p> The objective of this project was to make an animated carousel of quotes. However, going one step further, I 
       decided to pick travel quotes that would pair well with some of my vacation pictures. This resulted in 
       a "PowerPoint-like" presentation with an automated timer where each slide has a maximum of 3 seconds before
       disappearing and switching over to the next slide.</p>
