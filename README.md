# PORTFOLIO INTRODUCTION
<h1>💖 Welcome to my Portfolio 💖 </h1>
<p> Most of my samples came from in-class projects through the 15 week Web Development program at the South
  Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). However, outside of the program I have also dabbled in Python,
  C++ and C#.</p>
<p>I love to continuously learn and collaborate with other web devs so any feedback is always welcomed! I hope you enjoy my
site!</p>

  <h3>💾 CSS Animation Sample</h3>
  <p> The objective of this in-class assignment was to take a week's worth of teaching in design principles and
  project it through a CSS animation example. The animation can be anything you like as long as it is centered around
  content.</p>
  <p> Though I used HTML to set the base structure for this webpage, I used CSS to animate the floating boxes. 
    By using a Z-index, it made it easier to put a '<div>' on top of the content and have that '<div> slide from 
    one corner to the next </p>
