<h1>💖 💖 Welcome to my portfolio site 💖 💖</h1>
<p> This site was developed as a part of my final project for the South Alberta Institue of Technology (SAIT) in Calgary.
    Though some of the examples on my portfolio site is driven from in-class assignments, the rest of the examples
    showcase some of the other languages I've learned on my own. The SAIT program is a 15 week bootcamp-style 
    program so going through this process, a lot of the techniques we've had to learn on our own and certainly
    if you desired to learn a language above or beyond the scope of the course. In light of this, I hope you
    enjoy my site and feel free to connect!
