# PORTFOLIO INTRODUCTION
<h1> Welcome to my Portfolio </h1>
<p> Most of my samples came from in-class projects through the 15 week Web Development program at the South
  Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). However, outside of the program I have also dabbled in Python,
  C++ and C#.</p>
<p>I love to continuously learn and collaborate with other web devs so any feedback is always welcomed! I hope you enjoy my
site!</p>
